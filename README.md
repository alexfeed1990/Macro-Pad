# Open Macro-Pad

Hey, you. Yes you. Have you ever wanted a stream deck but jumped out of your chair when you saw the price?
Well no worries because the assembly cost for this shit is 17 dollars on the bottom side (74 dollars for the whole thing) on jlcpcb and an atmega mcu is like 25!

Seriously now this thing is my first keyboard pcb the traces are garbage and the pcb placement is absolutely horrid
it is thick as fuck i could fit an encoder in there but fuck if i know how to do that
and also good luck getting qmk on it i wish you luck (i didnt do it)
